# Some Discord.js stuff
## Don't use this, theres no reason to

This is just me experimenting with Discord.js
Don't use this, theres no reason to, there are many other bots you can already use and just the [discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide) so yeah

If you do wanna get this running, provide a `TOKEN`, `APPID` and `TESTSERVERID` in a `dotenv` file. Token is of course the token, app id the application id and the test server id the ID of a server for testing the bot. The rest will pretty much be self explanatory (if not, I don't leave comments or anything, figure it out yourself).
